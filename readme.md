How to View Scenario 0

I have generated the Start Page ("Scenario 0") for your medieval roguelike game.

Features Implemented

Atmosphere: A "Lord of the Rings" inspired dark fantasy aesthetic using MedievalSharp and Cinzel fonts, particle effects (embers), and responsive buttons.

Architecture: The App component is set up as a State Machine. It currently defaults to scenario: 0.

Data Models: I have created the HERO_DEFAULTS constant within the code containing the specific attributes (Health, Speed, Offensive/Passive skills) for Merlin, Arthur, Archer, and the Architect as requested.

Buttons:

New Expedition: Initializes the game state. Currently, it triggers an alert confirming the action, ready to be connected to Scenario 1.

Resume Chronicle: Visual placeholder (Disabled).

Ancestral Legacy: Visual placeholder (Disabled).

Next Steps

When you are ready for Scenario 1 (The Castle), I will:

Update the App component to switch scenario to 1.

Build the Expedition Office UI to allow selecting 4 heroes from the roster.

Build the Main Hall for random events.
