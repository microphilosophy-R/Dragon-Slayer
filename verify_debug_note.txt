// Use CJS for verification to avoid ESM issues with transpiled code
// Assuming the source is transpiled or we need to use 'esm' loader.
// Actually, the source uses 'export class'. It IS ESM.
// The error was "Named export 'Character' not found... CommonJS module".
// This implies the files are being treated as CJS by Node because .js extension and no type:module.
// But they use 'export'.
// If they are truly ESM, we should use .mjs or type:module.
// If they are transpiled by Babel in the project but we are running raw node, we have a problem.
// The user's project likely uses Webpack/Babel.
// We can try to use `esm` package if available, or just rename source files to .mjs for the test? No, that messes up project.
// We can try to mock the classes if we can't load them.
// But we want to test IT.
// Let's try to use `require` and see if we can perform a basic test, 
// BUT the source code has `import/export` statements, so `require` will fail with "Unexpected token export".

// We need to run this with an ESM loader or similar.
// Or we can try to rely on the fact that `verify_events.mjs` failed because `Character.js` was treated as CJS?
// "The requested module './src/models/Character.js' is a CommonJS module"
// valid ESM import from CJS: `import pkg from ...`
// But `Character.js` has `export class`. That should NOT be CJS.
// UNLESS... Wait. Node treats .js as CJS by default.
// If `Character.js` has `export` keyword, Node should have failed with "Unexpected token export" if it treated it as CJS.
// BUT it said "Named export not found". This usually happens when importing a CJS file that uses `module.exports`.
// Did I edit `Character.js` to use `module.exports`? No.
// Maybe I am misinterpreting the error.
// "SyntaxError: Named export 'Character' not found" means Node successfully parsed it as CJS (maybe?) and found no named export.
// This is very strange for a file with `export class`.

// Wait, looking at `package.json` would resolve if type is module.
// I tried `Get-Content package.json` but didn't read output?
// Ah, I missed reading the output of `Get-Content package.json`.
// Let's check `package.json` first.
